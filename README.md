<h1>SoBi-Spotter</h1>

SoBi Spotter is a responsive web-application that helps users of the Social Bicycles program in Hamilton, ON utilize
the program more effectively. The app utilizes <a href="http://open.hamilton.ca/">Hamilton Open Data</a> to locate all of the
SoBi hubs in the city, and create a map that can be utilized by users to find the closest hub to them, plan a trip between
any two hubs, and search the map by neighbourhoods in Hamilton by using the search bar. Currently, the app is designed as a
plain HTML5/Javascript application. The future goals of this app are to port it to React-Native in order to make it more 
accessible as a cross-platform mobile app.
